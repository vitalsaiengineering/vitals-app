Wealthbox API v1

Introduction
The Wealthbox API consists of REST-based resource URLs which provide a predictable way to interact with Wealthbox over JSON or XML.

We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application.

The Wealthbox API gives you powerful read/write access to your CRM account data, allowing you to build integrations with your other preferred tools.

API Endpoint
https://api.crmworkspace.com
Authentication
Every request to the Wealthbox CRM needs to be identified and authorized. In order to do this, you must provide API credentials, which can take the form of an API access token, provided inside your personal settings, or by leveraging our OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.

Authenticating with a personal API access token
Personal API access tokens are reserved for building personal integrations — such as those to in-house systems — and testing integration capabilities. If you are a current or future integration partner who makes your app available to mutual customers, authenticating with OAuth is required for co-marketing and release.

Authenticate your account when using the API by including an API access token in the request header. In order to obtain a new access token or to manage your existing tokens, please visit the API access token settings page. From there, simply click 'Create Access Token' and give the token a name. That token should then be passed as an HTTP Header, with the name ACCESS_TOKEN, in all requests to the API.

Authenticating with OAuth
The Wealthbox API allows authenticating with OAuth 2.0 using authorization code grants as well as refresh token grants as defined in RFC6749. Authorization is scoped to individual users (who may have different permissions from one another) rather than organizations.

To begin, you’ll need to register so we can issue a client ID and client secret which will uniquely identify your application to us. The client ID is a public value which will be exposed when the authorization flow begins in the user’s browser. The client secret, though, will be known only to you and us and is used to verify your identity. You will need to store it safely. If your client secret is compromised, please contact us immediately so we can deactivate it and issue a replacement.

To implement OAuth for your application, please email support@wealthbox.com with your request and details about your application.

The basic flow of OAuth is as follows:
Most of the following information is about OAuth 2.0 in general and isn’t unique to Wealthbox, in the examples below, we’ll use placeholder values forclient_id, client_secretandredirect_uriwhich you’ll need to replace with your unique values.

The code grant flow begins in a user’s browser. You should navigate them tohttps://app.crmworkspace.com/oauth/authorizewith the following query parameters appended to the URL:
# Parameters
client_id     => required
redirect_uri  => required(must match the URI that was registered)
response_type => required(only "code" authorization flow supported)
scope         => optional(available scopes are (login, data) login is default if not included)

# Example GET
https://app.crmworkspace.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL&response_type=code&scope=login+data
If the user isn’t currently logged in to their Wealthbox account, they’ll be prompted for their Wealthbox credentials first.
After entering their credentials, the user will be shown an authorization page to grant your application access to the Wealthbox API on their behalf.
After the user has granted access, the browser will navigate to your redirect URI. This will include the authorization code in the query string.
Your application can then exchange the authorization code for an access token via POST tohttps://app.crmworkspace.com/oauth/tokenwith anapplication/x-www-form-urlencodedpayload (like query parameters, but in the body instead of the URL). This should occur immediately as the authorization code has a brief lifetime.
# Parameters
client_id     => required
client_secret => required
code          => required(the code value which was included with the redirect)
grant_type    => required(only "authorization_code" supported)
redirect_uri  => required(must match the URI that was registered)

# Example POST
POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Host: app.crmworkspace.com
Accept: application/json
Content-Length: 255
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
https://app.crmworkspace.com/oauth/token?client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&code=CODE&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL

# Example Response (application/json)
{
 "access_token":"de6780bc506a0446309bd9362820ba8aed28aa506c71eedbe1c5c4f9dd350e54",
 "created_at":10588285800,
 "expires_in":7200,
 "refresh_token":"8257e65c97202ed1726cf9571600918f3bffb2544b26e00a61df9897668c33a1",
 "scope":"login data",
 "token_type":"Bearer"
}
Currently, eachaccess_tokenlives for two hours. Therefresh_tokenlives for 90 days.
If your access token expires, you will need to use the refresh token to POST tohttps://app.crmworkspace.com/oauth/token. This is similar to step 5 exceptgrant_typemust be set to "refresh_token"
# Parameters
client_id     => required
client_secret => required
grant_type    => required(must be "refresh_token")
refresh_token => required(the previously obtained refresh_token value)
If your refresh token has expired, you will need to start the process over from step 1. We recommend that apps autonomously connect to Wealthbox CRM using the refresh token, within the 90 day window, if they want to avoid forcing the user to reauthenticate.
Example Request with API access token
$ curl https://api.crmworkspace.com/v1/contacts -i \
-H "ACCESS_TOKEN:12345678901234567890123456789012"
Example Request with OAuth access token
$ curl https://api.crmworkspace.com/v1/contacts -i \
-H "AUTHORIZATION: Bearer 12345678901234567890123456789012"
Errors
Wealthbox uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the status of an API request. Generally, 2xx response codes indicate success, 4xx represents a problem that occurred (e.x., authentication token was not included in request, or required fields were not present to create a "contact"). 5xx codes indicate there was an error on the server, even though your request appears valid.

HTTP Status Code Summary
200 - OK	Everything worked as expected.
201 - Authorization token created	After a successful authorization via the API, an access token was created.
202 - Two-Factor Authentication required	After a successful authorization via the API, Two-Factor authentication is required.
400 - Bad Request	The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.
401 - Unauthorized	No valid API key provided.
402 - Trial expired	Your Wealthbox trial account has expired.
403 - Inaccessible	The requesting user does not have permission to view the resource.
404 - Not Found	The requested item doesn't exist.
422 - Invalid request parameters	Your request was invalid and rejected by the server.
422 - Unprocessable Entity	The content-type in the header may be invalid or the object sent doesn't match the content-type that was set.
429 - Too Many Requests	Too many requests hit the API too quickly.
5xx - Server Errors	Wealthbox error (Rare occurrence.)
Pagination
All resources in the API have support for retrieving in bulk via the list methods. For example, you could list all contacts, or all notes in your workspace.

We utilize a page-based system for listing items in bulk. This requires both per_page and a page parameter to be passed when retrieving paginated data (see below).

Pagination Parameters
per_page
number
25 (default)
page
number
1 (default)
Example Request
$ curl https://api.crmworkspace.com/v1/contacts?per_page=50&page=2 -i \
-H "ACCESS_TOKEN:12345678901234567890123456789012"
Responses from the API
Each request made to the API will generate a JSON or XML response. The responses can be classified into 3 distinct types.

Successful response returning a single resource
When returning a single resource, the object is represented as a JSON object of its properties.

Successful response returning a collection of resources
When returning a collection of resources, the collection is returned as a JSON object, whose key is the plural version of the resource, for example /v1/contacts returns a JSON object whose key is contacts. The object contains an array of the resources stored at that key. It is important to remember that these collections are not ordered, so their order can not be counted on.

Unsuccessful response
When a request is unsuccessful the API will return a JSON object with 2 keys, success,which will be set to false and an errors key which describes the error.

Versioning
When we make backwards-incompatible changes to the API we will release a new version. Examples of a backwards-compatible change that would not result in a new version would be adding a new endpoint, changing the order of properties in an API response, or adding a new optional property to an existing endpoint.

The current API version is v1, so any requests should include this in the URL.

Example Request
$ curl https://api.crmworkspace.com/v1/contacts -i \
-H "ACCESS_TOKEN:12345678901234567890123456789012"
Throttling
All requests made to the Wealthbox API are subject to throttling based on the API access token being used to make the request. The throttling rate is one request/second over a five minute sampling period, although, the Wealthbox API will permit short bursts of activity above that threshold. If you have made more requests to the Wealthbox API than permitted a 429 status code is returned to indicate that you have exceeded our rate limit for that period.
