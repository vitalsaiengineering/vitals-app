Based on the Wealthbox API documentation, I can help you track total opportunities by stage for a specific pipeline. Here's how you can accomplish this:

To retrieve opportunities by stage within a pipeline, you'll need to:

1. First, retrieve all opportunities using the GET `/v1/opportunities` endpoint
2. Then filter these opportunities based on the pipeline and stage information

Looking at the API documentation, here's the approach you should take:

1. Use the GET `/v1/opportunities` endpoint to retrieve all opportunities
   - This endpoint accepts parameters like `resource_id`, `resource_type`, `order`, and `include_closed`
   - Set `include_closed` to `true` if you want to include won and lost opportunities

2. The API returns opportunity data that includes the `stage` field, which is what you'll need to categorize opportunities by stage

3. Since the API doesn't have a direct filter for pipeline, you'll need to:
   - First get all opportunities
   - Then identify which pipeline each opportunity belongs to (this might be through the `custom_fields` or by analyzing the `stage` value)
   - Group and count the opportunities by stage within your target pipeline

The main challenge is that the API documentation doesn't explicitly show a pipeline field in the opportunity response. In many CRMs, pipelines contain stages, so you may need to:

1. Use the `/v1/categories/opportunity_pipelines` endpoint to get all pipelines
2. Use the `/v1/categories/opportunity_stages` endpoint to get all stages
3. Determine the relationship between stages and pipelines
4. Filter opportunities based on their stage, and then group them by pipeline

If you need to track this data regularly, you might want to create a script that:
1. Pulls all opportunities
2. Filters them by the pipeline you're interested in
3. Groups and counts them by stage
4. Stores or displays the results

Would you like me to provide code examples for implementing this tracking system, or do you need further clarification on any part of this approach?
